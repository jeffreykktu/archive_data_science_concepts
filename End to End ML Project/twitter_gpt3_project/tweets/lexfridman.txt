Here's my conversation with  about cybersecurity and cyberwar, an extremely important topic for the future of human civilization. Nicole is one of the best writers &amp; scholar in the world on this subject. This was terrifying and fascinating.  
I hope there will not be a war between Russia and Ukraine. Much of my family history is tied to these two countries. It breaks my heart to see the escalation of tension between them.
RT :  We are a mobile cell colony
 And a nearly infinite number of organisms lived and died to contribute to the genetic code that led to that 1 cell. We're all programmers, developing future lifeforms together.

RT :   Tim is great
Here's my conversation with Tim Urban () author of the blog Wait But Why and one of the most fascinating, insightful, and fun humans I have the pleasure of knowing and learning from. His blog is a national treasure.

Here's my conversation with , professor at Stanford University, known in part for taking a serious scientific approach to the topic of UFOs. We talk about UFO encounters, materials, and the search for and communication with alien civilizations.  
I stand with Joe Rogan. It is not a coincidence that the attacks calling him racist come as pressure on Spotify to censor builds.Politicians and the media profit on division &amp; outrage. They fuel the extremes that make us believe we're divided. We're not. We're in this together.
 Plus good friends.
The White House pressuring Spotify to censor Joe Rogan is un-American. We are better than this.
Too often, in online debates, each group believes they are the "smart people" group and the other groups are the "dumb people" groups. Humans are funny.

Bureaucracy and innovation don't mix well. 
People on Twitter are too quick to judge each other based on worst possible interpretations of tweets. Stop assuming the worst. Assume the best. It'll increase the amount of love and wisdom in the world.
Props to Spotify for backing Joe Rogan. Freedom wins.Podcasting is pirate radio.
12 mile hilly trail run done. I'm traveling, am under lots of pressure, a million excuses running through my head (busy, tired, etc). I really didn't want to run today, but I did it. Every time I want to quit is a chance to harden the mind, preparing it for when it truly matters. 
Here's my conversation with , John Danaher, and Gordon Ryan, each considered by many to be the greatest of all time in each of their respective martial arts disciplines.  
 Greatest romantic movie of all time.
I wish more young people dreamed about being inventors, engineers, scientists, and entrepreneurs than influencers.

I tweeted about cyberwar a few weeks ago. Now I know how a cyberattack feels on a personal level.I will be talking to a few cybersecurity experts in the coming weeks on the podcast, scheduled before this happened, but now becoming more personal.Please be careful out there üòî
I just got hacked. Ransomware named DeadBolt found an exploit in  storage devices, encrypting all files. They ask $1,000 from individuals or $1.8 million from QNAP. I have 50tb of data there, none of it essential or sensitive, but it hurts a lot. Time for a fresh start. 
Here's my conversation with Thomas Tull, founder of Legendary that produced Batman Dark Knight trilogy, Hangover, Godzilla, Inception, 300, etc. He runs Tulco, is part-owner of the Steelers &amp; plays guitar for Ghost Hounds that tour with The Rolling Stones.  
 Can I get a ride?
Spotify not caving under pressure to censor is admirable and important.
I'm talking with Mark Zuckerberg on the podcast in a few weeks. If you have questions or topic suggestions, please let me know. I will ask difficult questions. As always, there are no rules. But, my goal is to explore ideas that help heal division and give us hope for the future.
End of a 10 mile run from earlier today. There are few things I enjoy in life more than a long run along the river, alone with my thoughts or a good audiobook, when I'm at times struck by moments of simple happiness. I'm grateful to get to experience these moments &amp; to be alive.
